Homework for the project
Step-by-step guide to completing the final project
Combine all thematic calculations from homework assignments 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 into one Google Colab document. Revise them based on the feedback from the mentor and make changes as necessary to ensure they meet the acceptance criteria outlined below.
Create a presentation with the following set of slides:



Block 1. Personal Life Optimization

Introduction: Who you are.
Results of the analysis of the actual distribution of your time and the desired new time distribution.
Conclusions regarding the identification of necessary life changes, decisions made, and a brief plan of action regarding life changes.
Results of implementing changes (if you have implemented changes and have already achieved initial results).



Block 2. Description of Your Project

General description of the project (it could be a project of changes in your life or a project you are working on).
Gantt chart for this project.
Graph with the critical path marked on it.
Conclusions: as a project manager, what areas will you focus on to ensure project deadlines (most critical moments in the project, what needs special attention to prevent delays)?


Block 3. Cost of Changes in the Long-Term

Description of processes that you can describe using a function (income or savings growth, company income, etc.) with the specification of the function.
Actions leading to a change in the function (e.g., you will save more to generate passive income from your savings).
"Cost of the decision" â€” how much the result (area under the function graph) will be higher under the condition of implementing the corresponding decision: for 1 unit of time, for several units of time.


Block 4. Probabilistic Decision

Description of a probabilistic situation: you invest in a company, hire a new employee, etc. In terms of justification, you can consider decision-making in risk conditions (summary 10).
Assessment of the probabilities of this event.
Description and justification of your decision.


Block 5. Decision Optimization

Description of the situation (optimization of the types of services provided by the company, time of employees on the project, distribution of your own time, etc.).
Justification of the optimization task.
Solution to the optimization task (including graphs).
Formulation of conclusions.


Block 6. Conclusions and Reflection

Assessment of probable results from implementing acquired skills (in which areas, how, and what results can be achieved).
Your insights and impressions from completing the course.
